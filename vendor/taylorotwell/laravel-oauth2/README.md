# Laravel OAuth 2.0

**This is based on the CodeIgniter OAuth2 Spark maintained by Phil Sturgeon**

Authorize users with your application in a driver-base fashion meaning one implementation works for multiple OAuth 2 providers. This is only to authenticate onto OAuth2 providers and not to build an OAuth2 service.

Note that this Spark ONLY provides the authorization mechanism. There's an example controller below, however in a later version there will be a full controller.

## Installation via Composer

Add this to you composer.json file, in the require object;

    "taylorotwell/laravel-oauth2": "0.2.*"

After that, run composer install to install Laravel OAuth 2.0.

use OAuth2\Token_Access;
use OAuth2\Exception as OAuth2_Exception;

public function action_session($provider)
{
	$provider = OAuth2::provider($provider, array(
		'id' => 'your-client-id',
		'secret' => 'your-client-secret',
	));

	if ( ! isset($_GET['code']))
	{
		// By sending no options it'll come back here
		return $provider->authorize();
	}
	else
	{
		// Howzit?
		try
		{
			$params = $provider->access($_GET['code']);
			
        		$token = new Token_Access(array(
        			'access_token' => $params->access_token
        		));
        		$user = $provider->get_user_info($token);

			// Here you should use this information to A) look for a user B) help a new user sign up with existing data.
			// If you store it all in a cookie and redirect to a registration page this is crazy-simple.
			echo "<pre>";
			var_dump($user);
		}

		{
			show_error('That didnt work: '.$e);
